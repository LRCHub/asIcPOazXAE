Do you need help at all like me?
I saw you listening from the hallway
But I was too scared to say
Anything.

You make a big part of my head
I can't talk about anything else instead of you.
But I'm trying to.

I'll be the pirate if you'll be the loot,
I'll jump out a plane if you'll be my parachute.

You better catch me or I'll kill you.

Please don't think I'm mean,
Don't think I'm corny,
I don't know how to say this 'cause I've never had to
Now I want to.

Do you know what I mean like I do?
Do you know what I mean like I do?
I'm gonna get you,
Gonna get you.

Do you watch me? Would you watch me... TV?
Would you try to (see) me? Would you (call on me)?
