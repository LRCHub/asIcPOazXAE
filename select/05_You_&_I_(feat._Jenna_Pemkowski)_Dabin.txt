Don't wanna fight but
You don't know what you started
All in my mind like
I just don't make any sense
Burning alive but
I just don't seem to feel a thing
I'm holding on tight
While you run and hide
A million ways to forget me

Fire signs
Sparks fly
Hold it up to the sky
'Cause we
We ain't gonna live forever

Bright eyes
Open wide
All I see is you and I
But we
We ain't gonna live forever

And you see us too

I want you with me any place I will go
But eventually
I know you won't be there no more
I'm holding on tight
While you run and hide
You always make that look so easy
You made up your mind
But these red eyes
They don't seem to see what you see

Bright eyes
Open wide
All I see is you and I
But we
We ain't gonna live forever

And you see us too
